  description: |
    This API allows users to trigger an HMRC payment journey from their software. 
    
    The workflow enables an API user to redirect a customer through to an HMRC payment journey. 
    If an optional back-url was provided by the API user we will offer this as a link to the customer to continue their journey.
    
    Additional details about the outcome of the payment can be discovered 
    by the API user by taking advantage of the /status endpoint.

    Typical lifetimes for journey storage are not yet determined.

        The API user can check the payment status by providing the clientJourneyId used

        The JSON body returned will include the clientJourneyId, the taxRegime, the paymentReference, the amountInPence paid and also the paymentStatus. 
        *NOTE* the paymentStatus is a fixed enum, with scheduled meaning the payment has not been taken, but has been scheduled to be taken at a future date chosen by the user.

                      "Failed" - The user's payment journey has failed.  This can be due to a number of reasons - issues at HMRC or the user's bank e.g. insufficient funds, journey timed out before payment authorised, etc.
                      "Cancelled" - The payment was cancelled by the user before completion.
                      "Scheduled" - The user has successfully set up a future dated payment.  The payment will be made on the date selected by the user.  The payment can also be cancelled by the user at their bank before the payment date.
