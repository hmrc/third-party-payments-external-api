  description: |
    This API allows users to trigger an HMRC payment journey from their software. 
    
    The workflow enables an API user to redirect a customer through to an HMRC payment journey. 
    If an optional back-url was provided by the API user we will offer this as a link to the customer to continue their journey.
    
    Additional details about the outcome of the payment can be discovered 
    by the API user by taking advantage of the /status endpoint.

    Typical lifetimes for journey storage are not yet determined.

        After a successful call to the /pay endpoint, the API user receives JSON with a redirection URL. The API user
        then redirects the customer's browser to this URL, starting the payment journey.
        
        ### Test data
        Scenario simulation using Gov-Test-Scenario headers is *only available in the sandbox environment*.
        You will not be able to access the frontend screens to complete the journey, but you can use headers in the POST request 
        to set a journey into a certain state. To achieve this send a Gov-Test-Scenario header with a value matching one of the values below. 

        | Header Value (Gov-Test-Scenario) | Scenario description                                        |
        | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
        | COMPLETED                        | The payment has completed and the transfer is made.         |
        | FAILED                           | The payment has failed for one of the following reasons: <br> - The payment was cancelled by the user or timed out at the bank during the payment process. <br> - The bank or building society has rejected the payment. <br> - The payment has failed due to an error. |
        | IN_PROGRESS                      | The payment is in progress but has not completed or failed. |
