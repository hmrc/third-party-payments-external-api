    This API allows users to trigger an HMRC payment journey from their software. 
    
    The workflow enables an API user to redirect a customer through to an HMRC payment journey. 
    If an optional back-url was provided by the API user we will offer this as a link to the customer to continue their journey.
    
    Additional details about the outcome of the payment can be discovered 
    by the API user by taking advantage of the /status endpoint.

    Typical lifetimes for journey storage are not yet determined.

      requestBody:
        description: |
          The request body always contains the fields that allow HMRC to identify the liability that is being paid, so 
          that the funds are not mis-allocated. The required fields are the taxRegime, the paymentReference, the amountInPence, dueDate and 
          a journey identifier called the clientJourneyId.
          
          The taxRegime field identifies the tax being paid. Currently supported regimes are: Self Assessment.
          
          The paymentReference is the reference supplied by HMRC when the liability arose.
          
          The amountInPence is an integer number of pennies that must be greater than 0.  
          
          The clientJourneyId field is a UUID (version 4, variant 2) that is supplied by the API user in order to identify 
          the journey in calls to the /status endpoint.
          
          The API user can optionally supply a due date for the liability. This enables the user to setup a scheduled, future dated payment.
          This date must be in the future in format YYYY-MM-DD and cannot be today's date.
          
          The API user can optionally supply an additional URL.
          
          A backURL enables HMRC to display a link to the user to allow them to return to their software.

        The API user can check the payment status by providing the clientJourneyId used 
        when the payment journey was created.
        The JSON body returned will include the clientJourneyId, the taxRegime, the paymentReference, the amountInPence paid and also the paymentStatus. 
        *NOTE* the paymentStatus is a fixed enum, with scheduled meaning the payment has not been taken, but has been scheduled to be taken at a future date chosen by the user.
