  title: HMRC third party payments
  description: |
    This API accepts payments from outside of HMRC. There are two workflows possible,
      1. Fire and forget.
      2. Roundtrip.
    
    The *Fire and Forget* workflow enables an API user to redirect a customer through to an HMRC payment journey. At the
    end of the journey the user will be told to return to the originating software. If an optional back-url was provide
    by the API user we will offer this as a link to the customer to continue their journey.
    
    When the fire and forget workflow is chosen, additional details regarding the outcome of the payment can be 
    discovered by the api user by taking advantage of the /status endpoint.
    
    A *Roundtrip* workflow can be implemented by including an additional return-url. If this is present HMRC will
    post JSON representing the payment outcome to this endpoint [NB. Security?] that gives details about the payment including the amount
    the customer actually paid. Note that this amount may be zero.
    
    The /status endpoint can be used with roundtrip workflows as well. Note that journey details are not permanently
    stored at HMRC as they contain sensitive information. If the status for a journey can't be found (response 403)
    it indicates either that a journey with the submitted details was not made, or that the record has been deleted. 
    Typical lifetimes for journey storage are not yet determined.

        Begin a payment journey.
        
        On a successful call to the /pay endpoint to start the payment process the
        API user will receive JSON containing a redirection URL in return. They will then 
        redirect their customer's browser to that URL. This starts the journey for the customer.
      requestBody:
        description: |
          The request body *always* contains the fields that allow HMRC to be able to identify
          the liability that is being paid so that the funds are not mis-allocated. The necessary
          fields are the tax-regime, the reference, the amount, and a journey identifier called
          the vendor-journey-id.
          
          The tax-regime field identifies the tax being paid, currently Self Assessment (SA),
          Corporation Tax (CT), VAT, and EPAYE are supported.
          
          The reference is the reference supplied by HMRC when the liability arose.
          
          The amount is an integer number of pennies that must be greater than 0.
          
          The vendor-journey-id is a UUID (version 4, varient 2) that is supplied by the API user
          in order to identify the journey in calls to the /status endpoint.
          
          The API user can optionally supply two additional URLs.
          
          If the return-url is supplied, HMRC will post details of the customer's journey 
          in JSON format to that URL once the customer journey is complete.
          
          If the back-url is supplied, this url will be diplayed as a link to the customer
          at the end of the customer's journey to conveniently return to the API user's 
          systems.

            A 201 response tells the API user that the journey has been created and the customer

        Discover the status of a payment. 
        
        The API user can discover the status of a payment when they provide the tax-regime, reference, and vendor journey id
        that was provided when the payment journey was first created. The JSON returned will repeat these three fields and add
        the amount that the customer actually paid. *Note* that the amount can be zero in the return denoting that no money
        was transferred to HMRC because the journey has not completed with money transferred to HMRC. This can arise from
        a number of situations but HMRC will not provide any further information.
