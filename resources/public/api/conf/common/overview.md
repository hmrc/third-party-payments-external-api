This API allows third party accounting software providers to:

- send users to GOV.UK to start a payment journey with HMRC
- prepopulate the user's reference and amount in the payment journey
- find out the status of the user's payment journey (for example, if the payment was completed, scheduled, cancelled or unsuccessful)
